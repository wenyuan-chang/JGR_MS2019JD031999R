#### 1. Data description:
The winter observational PM2.5 data were the hourly concentrations in four winter months (November–December–January–February) from November 2013 to February 2019 that were obtained from the routine measurements of China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC). 
The remaining missing values were substituted by the interpolation values between the preceding and following PM2.5 concentrations. The final PM2.5 data comprised 720 concentration values for each city, consisting of six winters (four months each) and 90 cities with the majority located in northern and eastern China (herein referred to as northern China for simplicity, Figure S1a) where the PM2.5 concentrations were often extremely high in winter.

There are 103 sites with PM2.5 concentration (ug/m3) at 06:00UTC for October to March in 2013-2019.

#### 2. Data Preprocess:
1. Remove the site with missing values more than 10% of the whole records over the six winters.
2. The concentration of PM2.5 for each city was calculated from PM2.5 values that were measured at the reserving sites in the city.
3. The city without continuous missing values longer than three days was kept.

#### 3. Missing values:
-99.
