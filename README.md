#### Title: Asymmetrical Linkages between Multi-frequency Atmospheric Waves and Variations in Winter PM2.5 Concentrations in Northern China during 2013â€“2019
#### Manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research

#### 1. Data description:
The page provides the instantaneous PM2.5 concentrations at 06:00UTC that are in use for the manuscript submitted to JGR_MS2019JD031999R.
The raw data was downloaded from the http://data.epmap.org. The data in this page was preprocessed in the following steps:
 
1. Remove the sites that have missing values more than 10% of the whole records over the six winters.
2. The instantaneous PM2.5 concentration of each city was calculated from the PM2.5 values that were measured at the reserving sites in the city.
3. The city without continuous missing values longer than three days was kept.

In the download "tar" file, there are 36 files (pm25.yyyymm.txt) and each has the instantaneous PM2.5 concentration (ug/m3) at 06:00UTC in a month from October to March in 2013-2019. Each file has 103 rows indicating 103 cities and n columns, where n denotes the amount of days in that month. To attain the final PM2.5 data in the mansucript, the remaining missing values in the download files are need to be further substituted by the interpolation values between the preceding and following PM2.5 concentrations.

#### 2. Missing values:
-99.
